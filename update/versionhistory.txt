1.0.0: Jan 2012: initial release

1.0.1: Jan 2012: fixes Netatalk date-stamp bug (thanks to Steven Hirsch)

1.0.2: Jan 2013: Netatalk 2.2.4; OS X 10.7+ login fixed; netboot fixes;
                 Raspbian "Wheezy" support; Ubuntu 12.04 LTS support

1.1.0: Apr 2013: Full GS/OS install; eliminated GS.SYSTEM volume;
                 Raspberry Pi enhancements; lots of improvements to installer;
                 more utilities installed for Apple II; improved cppo
                 NOTE: fresh install required, can't update earlier version

1.1.1: Jun 2013: Wi-Fi support; updates/additions to commands in a2server-help;
                 bug fixes and improvements to install script; appletalk kernel
                 module for Raspbian (instead of replacement kernel); RPi
                 console (onboard serial) set to 19,200 bps during boot

1.1.2: Oct 2013: resolves issue of no AppleTalk in Raspbian 2013-09-10 and
                 later; faster command-line installation on Raspberry Pi
                 (nulib2 and unar binaries are downloaded rather than compiled)

1.1.3: Jan 2014: shares ADTPro disks folder as ADTDISKS; added environment
                 variables for shared folders; can resolve by name
                 "a2server.local" if network client has Bonjour/zeroconf;
                 server presents itself as Shared computer to Macs on network;
                 VM based on Debian 7

1.1.4: Jan 2014: fixes bug with network boot if ADTPro disks folder is shared

1.1.5: Jul 2014: a2server-setup fixes Raspbian 20-Jul-14 AppleTalk kernel panic

1.2.0: Aug 2014: a2server-setup and Netatalk startup script addresses AppleTalk
                 kernel panic on any Linux kernel 3.12-3.15; Netatalk starts
                 in background, preventing startup delay; a2server-setup always
                 configures Netatalk startup script and can download a new one
                 if missing; a2server-setup on Raspbian or Debian 7 x86 is
                 faster because it downloads binaries rather than compiling
                 from source; unbit/unexec/usq unarchivers added; additional
                 virtual machine which has both A2SERVER and A2CLOUD installed

                 automatically to 'apple2'; status messages are now prefixed by
                 A2SERVER:; can update Raspple II (Raspbian OS,
                 NOOBS install manager, A2SERVER, and A2CLOUD); minor fixes.

                 install Marinetti 3.0b8 with internet access via MacIP;
                 fully install Spectrum, SAFE2, SAM2, SNAP, MountIt; install
                 DOS3.3 and TEACH; remove Ubuntu support; move/media/A2SHARED/*
                 to /srv/A2SERVER; faster install (precompiled binaries) on

                 case filenames; nulib2 handles empty forks (thanks Andy);
